# ToDo-App

This project is specially developed to help people manage
their routines properly. This will let users make a timely routine of each day so
they can follow it. This will be more useful for the students or the college-going
youth.

This system uses Android Studio for its front end development and functioning.
This app doesnâ€™t need a backend as this type of applications use the data from the
phone itself and projects that to the user. The data will be stored locally in the
device using SQLite.
